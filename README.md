# attend

A CLI for shaping and guiding computer attention on macOS — block, friction,
nudge, and allow rules applied to domains, paths, and apps. Designed to be
driven by AI agents as well as humans.

## Status

v0.1. Single-user, macOS-only. Working: block, friction, nudge, allow,
recurring schedules, browser-side path-level enforcement, /etc/hosts-based
domain enforcement, app polling/quit. Not yet wired: native-app friction
overlays (only block works for native apps).

## Components

- **`attend`** — CLI client (Go). Talks to the daemon over localhost HTTP.
  All output is JSON, all errors are structured.
- **`attendd`** — long-running daemon (Go). Owns the rule store; enforces
  via `/etc/hosts` and a macOS app-polling loop. Run as a root LaunchDaemon
  for system-wide effect.
- **Browser extension** — Chromium MV3 extension. Required for path-level
  rules and for enforcing block/friction at the page-load layer (which works
  even when Chrome's Secure DNS bypasses `/etc/hosts`).
- **`AttendFriction`** — minimal SwiftUI helper for native-app friction
  screens (scaffolded; not yet wired into the daemon).

## Install

Two flavors: user-level (no sudo, but `/etc/hosts` writes will fail) and
system-wide (LaunchDaemon as root, full enforcement).

```sh
# Build + install as a user LaunchAgent. /etc/hosts blocks will be no-ops.
./install/install.sh

# Build + install as a root LaunchDaemon. /etc/hosts writes work.
sudo ./install/install-system.sh
```

After install, load the browser extension at `chrome://extensions/` →
Developer mode → Load unpacked → select the `extension/` directory.

If your browser ships with DNS-over-HTTPS on (Chrome does), turn it off at
`chrome://settings/security` so `/etc/hosts` rules apply. Or rely on the
extension and skip the system-wide daemon entirely.

## Quick start

```sh
# Block, hard
attend block twitter.com
attend block app:Slack --schedule-json '{"tz":"America/Los_Angeles","windows":[{"days":["mon","tue","wed","thu","fri"],"start":"09:00","end":"17:00"}]}'

# Friction (default level: intent — type why you're opening this)
attend friction reddit.com --cooldown 10m

# Nudge
attend nudge youtube.com --message "is this the move?"

# Carve-out: block reddit, allow one subreddit through the browser
attend block reddit.com
attend allow reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA

# One-shot
attend block youtube.com --for 2h

# Pause everything for a meeting
attend pause --for 1h
attend resume

# Always check state first (especially from agents)
attend status
attend ls
attend rm <id>
```

## Architecture

```
attend (CLI) ──HTTP──► attendd ──┬──► /etc/hosts        (domain blocks)
                                 ├──► osascript quit    (app blocks)
                                 └──► state file        (rules + settings)
                                          ▲
                                          │
                              browser extension polls /v1/status,
                              renders block / friction overlays at
                              document_start time
```

Rule precedence: `allow > block > friction > nudge`. When a path-allow rule
falls under a domain block, the daemon drops the domain from `/etc/hosts`
so the browser can load the page and enforce the carve-out itself.

## Limitations

- macOS only. The daemon assumes `/etc/hosts`, `osascript`, and `launchd`.
- Only Chromium-family browsers tested. Firefox manifest would need a
  separate build.
- No HTTPS interception, so path-level rules require the browser extension.
  System-wide path-level blocking would require a local proxy with a
  trusted CA, which is intentionally out of scope.
- Block rules on `domain:reddit.com` cover `www.reddit.com` (subdomain),
  but `/etc/hosts` only sinkholes the bare host. Apps that hit
  `www.reddit.com` directly are not affected by a `reddit.com` rule.

## Development

See `CLAUDE.md` for layout, build/test, and hot-reload workflow. The
`SKILL.md` file is the agent-facing usage guide; symlink it into
`~/.claude/skills/attend/SKILL.md` (or your IDE's equivalent) to make it
discoverable.
